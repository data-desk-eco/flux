# Burnoff

Client-side Sentinel-2 SWIR flare detection with P2P sync, plus a
VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) mode for browsing EOG's satellite flare catalog.

Zero npm dependencies. The only external libraries are MapLibre GL (map
rendering), geotiff.js (COG reads), DuckDB-Wasm with spatial support, and the
s2e rust core compiled to wasm (the flare detector) — all vendored under
`web/vendor/` and `web/flaring/s2/`. Everything else — CRDT, WebRTC mesh, sync protocol,
IndexedDB persistence, UTM projection math, and the signal server's WebSocket
framing — is hand-rolled using web standards.

     Sentinel-2 L2A COGs         VNF Parquet (CloudFerro archive)
     (B12, B11, B8A, SCL)
```

**S2 mode:** The default data source reads the Data Desk Sentinel-2 tables
straight from the CloudFerro public parquet archive. `data-desk/flares/data.parquet`
is **one object** — one row per cluster, with the site's quarterly history nested
in a `quarters` list — so `web/flaring/s2archive.js` reads it once through Cartograph's
DuckDB layer and serves every viewport from those rows (bbox + date-overlap
filter). There is no bucket listing and no MGRS partition: the archive partitions
only past 250 MB, and it partitions on `cell`, an H3 resolution-1 index a reader
calculates from a position rather than discovers by listing. The per-date series
left the cluster row with the old view — it lives in
`data-desk/detections/data.parquet` (`kind = 'flare'`, joined on `site_id`) and is
fetched per cluster when a card opens. `archiveFeature` maps a row straight to the
Feature shape `crossDateCluster` emits, so the avg-B12 slider gates client-side
but the server-side clustering is not re-run.

**Persistence history (resolved 2026-07-31).** For a period the cluster view
carried `persistence` NULL and `persistence_score` 0 for 9,595 of its 9,603
clusters, so `total_score` lost its `0.40·persistence_score` term while keeping
the glint penalty and the archive's mean score was −0.126. The cause was not a
deletion: 125 of the 126 detection tiles arrived in a single bulk parquet import
(2026-07-18) with no canonical records and **no cloud masks**, so the clear-sky
denominator was never computed for them rather than lost. Compounding it, the
detector ran `--source cdse-l1c` while its cloud mask reads SCL, which only L2A
carries — so flare runs wrote empty cloud records regardless.

Both are fixed: `s2e` v0.2.0 resolves SCL from the L2A twin of each acquisition
whatever `--source` asks for, and a full coverage scan (139,478 scenes, archived
at `ops/s2e-coverage/`) rebuilt the view on 2026-07-31 — all 9,603 clusters now
carry a measured persistence. Re-deriving it costs ~20 s via
`s2e cluster --coverage-scan <dir> --coverage-reuse`.

**That rebuild then deflated every persistence by roughly four (found and fixed
2026-07-31, view republished the same day).** The scan dir is windowless and
resumable: it holds every scene ever sampled, 2015→2026. The detections it is the
denominator for cover whatever window was actually run — 2025 for most tiles. The
aggregation read the whole dir, so this year's detections were divided by a
decade of clear looks. The Sabine Pass flare, lit on 54 of its 60 clear looks in
2025, published 18%. This is the VNF calendar bug in another guise, and the rule
is the one that repo settled on: **numerator and denominator over the same looks,
or the rate is not a rate.** s2e v0.2.2 counts a clear look only where the
detector ran, evidenced by a detection in that tile on that date, and publishes no
persistence at all below ten measured looks.

The republished view (s2e v0.2.2 on a fleet box, `s2e cluster --archive …
--coverage-scan cov --coverage-reuse --out s3://…/data-desk/flares`; the binary does
not build on macOS — gdal and candle both fail): Sabine Pass 54/60 = 90%, median
persistence 1.8% → 4.3%, median denominator 169 → 84 looks, clusters clearing the
UI's 25% default 314 → 1,178, mean `total_score` −0.126 → −0.097, and 68 of 9,603
rows now carry no persistence because fewer than ten looks were measured. Repeat
it in ~2 min from the scan tarball in `ops/s2e-coverage/`, which is why that
tarball is kept.

**The looks are published, so do not recompute them.** Every flares row carries
`quarters`, its own history on the first-day-of-quarter key, and the struct is
the same one both providers write: `quarter, days, observations, clear,
detections, detections_clear, rh_sum, rh_max`. **`clear` is the cloud-free look
count persistence divides by; `observations` is every look an instrument took.**
Reading `observations` where `clear` belongs compiles, runs, and silently changes
what persistence means — so both modes go through one reducer, `sumQuarters`
(clustering.js), and the only numerator that pairs with `clear` is
`detections_clear`. `archiveFeature` sums the quarters the picker is showing and
divides the detections in those quarters by exactly those looks: numerator and
denominator over the same looks, no browser-side estimate. Below ten looks in the
selection it publishes no rate at all, the floor s2e applies to the whole-window
count (`MIN_LOOKS`, clustering.js).

The tables also publish a whole-history `persistence` column. **Do not wire it
through.** The app deliberately recomputes the rate over exactly the ticked
quarters; using the published one would compile, look right, and make the quarter
picker stop affecting the number.

`card.js` therefore computes no rate at all: it reports what the feature carries.
What it replaced was `detections / persistence` to recover the denominator, then
prorating that denominator by the share of quarters selected and re-dividing — a
guess wearing a measurement's clothes.

**Which means the card can go stale, and `refreshS2Archive` has to un-stale it.**
Each map dot now carries the numbers for the ticked quarters alone, rather than
the numbers for all time. Opening a card copies that dot's numbers; it does not
hold a live reference. So when the quarter picker changes, `refreshS2Archive`
rebuilds every dot with new numbers and the open card is left showing the copy it
took under the old selection — Q4 alone, still reading 90% over 60 looks. The last
line of that function calls `reselectCurrentFeature()`, which finds the dot at the
same coordinates and re-opens the card from it. VNF has always needed this;
before the features were quarter-scoped, S2 did not.

The `--clouds` fold-in path never had this bug: those masks are written during
detection, so they only ever cover scenes the detector actually read. It is the
default for a reason; the coverage scan is the fallback for the tiles whose
canonical records (and cloud masks) the bulk import lost.

A row that lacks a persistence — the 68 thin-look sites, and any tile a future
scan has not reached — carries no observation count either, so the card reads '—'
for both rather than passing off `date_count` as the nights we could have seen, and
the Minimum-persistence gate treats it as *unrated* (it passes) in S2 mode. VNF
keeps the opposite branch: there a null is a finding (no clear night in the
window) and the flare is dropped rather than ranked. Do not "simplify" the two
branches back into one — coalescing to 0 in S2 mode is what sank the whole
archive below the slider's 25% default. The in-browser COG detection worker (`detect-worker.js`, the "Detect"
button) is the fallback for areas not yet archived: it runs the s2e rust core
compiled to wasm (`web/flaring/s2/wasm/`), the SAME binary methodology as the server-side
archive — there is no JS detector port (it drifted from the core and was removed).
Peers share a single CRDT document, idle peers read
the job from awareness state, partition blocks by hash, and process their share,
merging results via LWW-Map CRDT. The CRDT/mesh stack is **loaded lazily**
(`ensureDetect()` dynamically imports crdt/sync/rtc/store) only when the viewport
sits outside the archive's coverage — a pure-archive session never fetches it. The
archive base is set via `<meta name="data-bucket">` in index.html.

**VNF mode:** Cartograph's DuckDB layer reads the EOG tables in the shared Data
Desk CloudFerro archive under the `eog/` provider prefix. Neither this module nor
index.html names an object: `<meta name="data-bucket">` gives the bucket, and the
archive index says which object each table is. The viewport reads
`eog/flares/data.parquet`: one row per site, 20,227 of them, each carrying its
own quarterly history in a `quarters` list, so a bbox predicate and a JS window
over that list are the whole viewport query.

The daily series is `eog/detections/cell=<h3>/data.parquet`, sorted by `site_id`
inside a cell, read only on card open. **Every row there is a positive
detection** — there is no `detected` column, because the looks that found nothing
are rows in `eog/observations` instead. `cell` is an H3 resolution-1 index of the
site's position, and the flares row carries it, so a card resolves to exactly one
object with no bucket listing and **no H3 library in the browser**: nothing in
burnoff ever calculates a cell, it only ever passes one on. Plumb `cell` through
any new feature builder for the same reason.

Burnoff does not read `eog/observations` at all. The quarters list already
carries the looks a rate divides by, windowed the same way the numerator is;
fetching the daily denominator as well would be a second, larger read of a number
the app already has, and two places to get the pairing wrong. See
`~/Tools/etl/sql/tables/` for the table definitions and their checks.

## S2 Detection Algorithm

Sentinel-2 L2A at 20m resolution via Element84 STAC COGs.
Runs entirely client-side in a Web Worker with windowed reads (geotiff.js).

Processing uses fixed 256x256 pixel blocks within each tile.
Each block is identified by `{mgrs}_{row}_{col}` and cached by `block_id:date`.

```
Per-block pipeline (fused into minimal passes):

  1. STAC search for L2A images in viewport (no scene-level cloud filter)
  2. Read SCL band first for cloud check
  3. Cloud check via SCL: skip blocks >75% cloud; mark blocks >30% as not cloud-free
     (for persistence metric — blocks between 30-75% are still processed)
  4. Read B12, B11, B8A bands (windowed, 10px overlap)
  5. Pre-pass: B12 DN -> reflectance, collect background for median
  6. Fused pass: B11/B8A DN -> reflectance + brightness + contrast + thermal -> mask
     - Brightness:  B12 > 0.3 AND B11 > 0.2
     - Contrast:    B12 > median(background) * 3.0, floor 0.15
     - Thermal:     NHISWNIR = (B11 - B8A) / (B11 + B8A) > 0 OR saturation
  7. Connected components (BFS, 4-connectivity)
  8. Cluster filters: size, peak, peakedness, single-pixel, warm-region halo
  9. Overlap dedup: canonical block via floor(pixel / 256)

Each detection also carries glint/spectral annotations (s2e core; the
glint geometry helpers are re-exported from `web/flaring/s2/score.js`):
  - sun_elevation/sun_azimuth (STAC view extension, via stac.js)
  - glint_angle = 90 - sun_elevation; glint_score (1.0 ≤25°, →0 at 65°)
  - peak_b11, b12_b11_ratio (flames are hot, ratio >~1.3; glint is flat ~1.0)

Cross-date clustering (main thread, grid-indexed):
  - Anchor-based merge, configurable radius (0-200m, default 135m)
  - Minimum 4 distinct dates per cluster
  - Minimum average B12 per cluster: 0.85 (adjustable via UI slider) — the
    active quality gate
  - Glint false-positive flag: clusters whose minimum per-look glint_score is
    high (high-sun geometry across every look, no flame spectral evidence) are
    warned. Derived from sun_elevation, so it works on synced detections too.
    Replaces the old Apr–Aug seasonal heuristic.
  - Persistence metric: detections / observations per cluster
  - Cloud-free %: fraction of observations with ≤30% cloud (data quality indicator)

Cluster quality score (vision-validated methodology, web/flaring/s2/score.js) — computed
and shown in the detail card, NOT yet a gate. The formula was tuned in
~/Research/permian-flaring against an unbiased 2,826-site aerial study (sql/30):
  - total_score = 0.50·ratio_score
                + 0.40·persistence_score·(0.1 + 0.9·ratio_score)
                − 0.40·min_glint_score        (range −0.40 … +0.90)
  - ratio_score (0–1): smooth ramp on the B12/B11 ratio over 1.1→1.7 — the
    strongest precision signal. Peak-B12 brightness is FLAT as a ranking term and
    is dropped from the score (it is the recall floor, i.e. the avg-B12 gate).
  - persistence_score (0–1): the clear-sky share lit, n_dates / cloud-free obs.
    Its weight ramps with the ratio (the 0.1 floor keeps dim-but-real pads
    ordered); a flat additive persistence rewarded static reflectors.
  - glint_penalty (−0.40–0): linear in the cluster's MINIMUM per-look glint_score
    — a real flare fires across many sun geometries so its min drops low;
    geometric glint stays high. (permian's three hard gates — far-from-facility,
    on-building, on-road — need ground layers unavailable client-side, so they do
    not port; and the retired openflaring score's S3 corroboration term is not
    carried — no Sentinel-3 client-side.)
  - ratio_score needs B12/B11, which the binary sync codec does NOT carry. So
    synced/legacy detections have a null ratio and score on persistence·0.1 −
    glint alone. Until the ratio is added to the codec (a format change), the
    score is display-only and the avg-B12 slider stays the gate.
    `clusterDetections` accepts an optional `scoreThreshold` (default 0/off).
```

## VNF Data Pipeline

The pipeline lives in the sibling etl repo (`~/Tools/etl`, provider `eog/`).
It generates the calendar itself — every flare, every night from 2012-03-01 to
wherever the cloud series ends, about five days back — and lets EOG supply
detections only, so a night with no detection is a row saying "nothing seen",
not an absence. Whether we could have seen anything
is our own call: ERA5 total cloud cover sampled at each site's real VIIRS
overpass hours, clear below 0.6.

```
flare × night calendar → EOG profile CSVs   → eog/detections  (12.3M rows)
                       → ERA5 cloud at overpass hours → eog/observations (106.3M)
                       → terminals.geojson (6 km) → eog/flares (20,227 sites)
```

The split is the point. `eog/detections/cell=<h3>/data.parquet` holds **only**
the nights a site was seen lit: `site_id, date, lat, lon, cell, rh_mw, temp_k,
rate_kg_h, satellite, scene, sector` plus the EOG extension `flow_mcm`. There is
no `detected` column, because a look that found nothing is a row in
`eog/observations` and nowhere else — `provider, kind, site_id, date, lat, lon,
cell, observed, clear, cloud, looks, scene, source, final`. `observed` already
applies the platform-outage test, `cloud` is a fraction 0..1, and `clear` is the
one threshold (`cloud < 0.6`) so the word means the same thing whichever
instrument looked. `flow_mcm` carries EOG's own `Flow_Rate` but is NOT displayed:
the UI's MCM/d column is `rh_mw × 0.0315`, the JZ-RH VNF v3 calibration
(Zhizhin et al. 2025, Energies 18:4765 — BCM/yr = 0.0115×RH, metered-flare
validated). EOG's `Flow_Rate` implements the legacy Cedigaz power law, which
that paper shows overestimates dim flares and underestimates bright ones.

The viewport tier is `eog/flares/data.parquet` — one row per site, `id, provider,
kind, lat, lon, cell, country, detail, first_seen, last_seen, detections,
active_days, observations, persistence, score, flags, quarters` — where
`quarters` is the site's own history rolled up over the last four calendar years,
a `STRUCT[]` of `quarter, days, observations, clear, detections,
detections_clear, rh_sum, rh_max`. `days` is the exact night count in the
quarter, `detections_clear` counts detections on nights we could see, and
`detections` counts every detection including cloudy ones. **Never divide
`detections` by `clear`** — that pairing is what broke `lng-flaring`.

`type` and `category` are gone: they are joined into one `detail` string, which
is what the map falls back to for a name when no terminal is within 7.5 km. Ids
are VARCHAR now (`flares.id`, and `detections.site_id`/`observations.site_id`
join to it), so do not coerce them with `Number()` — EOG's happen to look
numeric, and another provider's will not.

`siteFeatures` (vnf.js) windows `quarters` to the ticked span and sums it through
`sumQuarters`, giving `passes` (Σ observations), `observations` (Σ clear),
`detection_dates` (Σ detections_clear), `detection_any` (Σ detections), `rh_sum`
and `max_rh`. Two ratios come out of it:

- `persistence` = `detection_dates / observations` — numerator and denominator on
  the same nights, so it is a rate. Null, not 0, where the clear count is 0 (a
  window holding no clear night measures nothing) or where `coverage` falls
  below `COVERAGE_MIN`. The card shows '—' and the layer filter drops the flare
  rather than ranking it.
- `avg_rh` = `rh_sum / detection_any` — `rh_sum` spans every detection, so its
  mean divides by every detection.

`coverage` is `Σ observations / Σ days`: the share of the selected window's
nights we read the sky for, over the exact night count rather than a 91-night
approximation. The calendar ends where the cloud series ends, so it no longer
counts nights ERA5 has not reached; what is left to catch is platform outages,
and those are per-site — one platform grounded still leaves the other flying,
and a single platform does not reach every site every night. `COVERAGE_MIN`
(0.8) is therefore a per-site gate rather than a per-quarter one: whole quarters
average 0.86–1.00 read, and the flares falling below the threshold are the ones
an outage covered — 708 and 644 of ~11,800 mapped flares in the two 2024 outage
quarters, 289 of 6,982 in the quarter in progress. See
`~/Tools/etl/sql/tables/` — `flares.sql`, `detections.sql`, `observations.sql`
and their `*.checks.sql`, which state exactly what a reader may rely on.

## P2P Sync

Two LWW-Maps in a shared CRDT document:
- `detections`: `block_id:date` -> detection array
- `processed`: `block_id:date` -> `[lat, lng]` (cloud-free) or `null` (cloudy)
  Binary codec: 4 bytes (2x i16), cloudy sentinel `i16(32767), i16(0)`

Persisted locally via IndexedDB, synced via WebRTC DataChannels +
custom binary sync protocol (state vectors, diffs, live updates).

Distributed detection: blocks are partitioned across peers by hashing
the cache key. Partition updates are sent to workers live (no restart).

## Signaling

WebSocket pub/sub relay for WebRTC signaling. Clients send JSON messages:
`subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `publish`, `ping`/`pong`.

**Local dev:** `signal/server.js` — stateless relay implementing RFC 6455
framing over `node:http` + `node:crypto`. Zero npm dependencies.
Runs on `ws://localhost:4444` via `make signal`.

**Production:** `signal/worker.js` — Cloudflare Worker with a Durable Object
using the WebSocket Hibernation API. Subscriptions are stored via
`serializeAttachment`/`deserializeAttachment` so they survive hibernation.
All connections route to a single global Durable Object (`idFromName('global')`).
Deploy with `npx wrangler deploy` (config in `wrangler.toml`).
URL: `wss://burnoff-signaling.louis-6bf.workers.dev`.

The signaling URL is set via `<meta name="signaling-url">` in `index.html`.
